Small Java library implementing Merkle Trees (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree).

## What is this good for

Well we use it to create content based indexes organized in directed graph like structure.

### Usecase: Find changes
Once you have obtained a Tree instance derived from your (potentially large) content tree you can use it to quickly find the needle in the haystack when compared to an older snapshot Tree.
